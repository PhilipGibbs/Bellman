Here is a conjecture for a specific case of the lost in a fest problem. My intention is simply to demonstrate how difficult a problem the general case is.

A hiker is lost in a triangular forest. His map shows that the forest is an isosceles traingle with angles 80, 80 and 20 degrees at the corners.
The length of the shortest straight edge is one mile.
He has no idea where in the forest he is or which direction he is facing.

_Conjecture_: The optimal escape path consists of two straight paths of length one mile each, with an angle of 60 degrees between them so they form two sides of an equilateral triangle.
